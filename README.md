# EcoNumericalMethod
## Introduction

The code for *Numerical Method in Economy* in Zhejiang University (Instructor: Prof. Eric R. Young).

The source code in the *./src/* fodler, and *./figure/* include the figures coming from the code.

Of course, all of this code is based on the MATLAB code given by the Prof. Eric R. Young and is translated into Python code by me, as my PC is inconvenient to use MATLAB and I am more familiar with Python.

## Code
